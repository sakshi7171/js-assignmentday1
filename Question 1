###console in JavaScript###

A Web console is a tool which is mainly used to log information associated with a web page like: network requests, javascript, security errors, warnings, CSS etc.
It enables us to interact with a web page by executing javascript expression in the contents of the page.
In javascript, the console is an object which provides access to the browser debugging console.
The console object provides us with several different methods, like :
log()
error()
warn()
clear()
time() and timeEnd()
table()
count()
group() and groupEnd()


/// console.log() method 
Mainly used to log(print) the output to the console. We can put any type inside the log(), be it a string, array, object, boolean etc.
Examples:
console.log('abc');  
console.log(1); 
console.log(true); 
console.log(null); 


/// console.error() method  
Used to log error message to the console. Useful in testing of code. By default the error message will be highlighted with red color.
Examples:
console.error('This is a simple error');  


/// console.warn() method  
Used to log warning message to the console. By default the warning message will be highlighted with yellow color.
Examples:
console.warn('This is a warning.');  


/// console.clear() method  
Used to clear the console. The console will be cleared, in case of Chrome a simple overlayed text will be printed like :
‘Console was cleared’ while in firefox no message is returned.
Examples:
console.clear();  


/// console.time() and console.timeEnd() method  
Whenever we want to know the amount of time spend by a block or a function, we can make use of the time() and timeEnd() methods provided by the javascript console object.
They take a label which must be same, and the code inside can be anything( function, object, simple console).


/// console.table() method 
This method allows us to generate a table inside a console. The input must be an array or an object which will be shown as a table.
Examples:
console.table({'a':1, 'b':2}); 


/// console.count() method 
This method is used to count the number that the function hit by this counting method.


/// console.group() and console.groupEnd() method 
group() and groupEnd() methods of the console object allows us to group contents in a separate block, which will be indented. 
Just like the time() and the timeEnd() they also accepts label, again of same value.
